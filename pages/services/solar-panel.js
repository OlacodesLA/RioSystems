                    been in and out. You will be able to know who had access,
                    the timing of their entry and exit, and where the entrance
                    occurred. All of this information will lead to a better
                    managed business, and ultimately, more control over your

                    everyday. Our key card access systems also alleviates the
                    need for traditional keys, eliminating trips to the hardware
                    store every time one is inevitably lost, or the early
                    morning or late night call you get when you have to let
                    someone who forgot their keys into the building.
